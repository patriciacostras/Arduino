The purpose of the project is to make use of PWM signals, timers and LM35 sensor and implement them. After the hardware is done after the sketch, using the code provided the project will make us of: PWM signal and timers ( to fade-in and fade-out a tranzistor; in a given time using prescalers ), LM35 sensor ( used with an ADC to convert from tension measured to temperature ), serial communication ( to display values and for input to toggle tranzistor).
